        Alan Turing was an English mathematician, logician, and cryptographer. He played a crucial role in breaking the Nazi Enigma code during World War II, which helped shorten the war and save millions of lives. Turing also laid the foundations for computer science and artificial intelligence through his invention of the Turing machine and his influential work on algorithms and computation. Despite his immense contributions, he was prosecuted for his homosexuality and died under tragic circumstances. In 2013, the British government issued a royal pardon, and he is now recognized as one of the most important thinkers of the 20th century.
